            <Text style={styles.p}>If you're looking to trade the Bearish Kicking Candlestick Pattern, there are a few things you need to know. First, this pattern is typically found at the top of an uptrend and signals a potential reversal. So, you'll want to be on the lookout for this pattern when the market is in an uptrend. Second, the Bearish Kicking Candlestick Pattern is made up of two candles. The first candle is a long white candle followed by a short black candle. The key here is that the black candle should close below the midpoint of the white candle. This is what signals the potential reversal. Finally, when trading this pattern, you'll want to enter on a break of the low of the black candle. This will give you the best chance of success.</Text>
