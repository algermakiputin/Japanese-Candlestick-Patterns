            <Text style={styles.p}>Dark Cloud Cover is a two-candlestick pattern that is formed when a down (black or red) candle opens above the close of the prior up a white candle, then closes below the midpoint of the up candle. When you spot the Dark Cloud Cover pattern on a Japanese candlestick chart, expect a potential bearish reversal.  It is not as strong a signal as the more definitive bearish engulfing pattern. Nonetheless, dark cloud cover is important to note as a potential bearish indicator, especially if it forms on a higher time frame chart, such as a daily chart. On lower time frames, its significance is considerably reduced.</Text>
