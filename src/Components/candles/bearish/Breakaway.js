            <Text style={styles.p}>The bearish breakaway pattern consists of five candles. It is a reversal formation that occurs during an uptrend. The first candle in the formation is long and white. The second candle is also a white candle the price opens higher creating a gap. The third candle can be both black and white but does not cut off the rise of the stock price. The fourth candle continues in the direction of the preceding trend. The fifth candlestick has a long black body, changes the direction of the trend, and continues in that direction to close the gap.</Text>

            <Text style={styles.p}>The key to trading this pattern is to look for a break of the low of the candle. This signals that the market is ready to move lower. The next step is to enter a short position at the opening of the next candle. The stop loss can be placed just above the high of the candle.</Text>
            <Text style={styles.p}>This is a great pattern for traders who are looking for a quick and easy way to trade the markets. This pattern can be used in any time frame and can provide some great profits.</Text>
