            <Text style={styles.p}>An Evening Doji Star consists of a long bullish candle, followed by a Doji that gaps up, then a third bearish candle that gaps down and closes well within the body of the first candle. The evening star pattern is considered a reliable indicator that a downward trend has begun. However, it can be difficult to discern amidst the noise of stock-price data. To help identify it reliably, traders often use price oscillators and trendlines to confirm whether an evening star pattern has in fact occurred.</Text>

            <Text style={styles.subHeading}>How to trade?</Text>
            <Text style={styles.p}>When trading this pattern, you will want to look for a bearish candlestick to form on the third day. This will confirm the pattern and give you a signal to enter a short position. You can place a stop loss just above the high of the second candle, and target the low of the first candle.</Text>
