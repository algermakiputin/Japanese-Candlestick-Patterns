            <Text style={styles.p}>The two crows candlestick pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that forms during an uptrend. In the two crows pattern, the market closes lower after an opening gap up during an uptrend. It is a popular pattern that gives an early signal of uptrend deterioration and a potential reversal of the trend. </Text>
            <Text style={styles.p}>The two crows candlestick pattern has three candles. The first candle is a long white candle that closes nears its high. The second candle is a small black candle that tends to create a gap by moving away from the previous day’s candle and closing near its low. However, its closing point is still above the high of the first candle. The third candle fills the gap between the first two candles and opens inside the body of the second candle. </Text>
