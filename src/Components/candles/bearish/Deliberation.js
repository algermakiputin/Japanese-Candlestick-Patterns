            <Text style={styles.p}>The deliberation pattern can occur in both bull and bear markets. This pattern is formed by two long white (or green) bodies that are then followed by a small white (or green) candle. The deliberation pattern can resemble two other candlestick patterns, depending upon whether it is bullish or bearish in nature. The bearish deliberation pattern resembles the three black crows and the bullish deliberation pattern resembles the three white soldiers' formation. It is important to note that the bullish deliberation pattern is a weaker pattern and is less popular than its counterpart, the bearish deliberation pattern. Many don’t use the bullish deliberation as a true reversal pattern but rather to signify a short-term price change indicator.</Text>
