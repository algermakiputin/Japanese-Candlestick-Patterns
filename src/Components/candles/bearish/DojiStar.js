            <Text style={styles.p}>The Bearish Doji Star is a bearish reversal pattern represented by two candles. First comes a long green candle, followed by a Doji candle that opens above the body of the first one, creating a gap. It is considered a reversal signal with confirmation during the next trading day. This pattern represents how an uptrend fades out and leads to a bearish reversal. The Doji at the end of the uptrend reflects how the bears have suddenly appeared to stop the trend and, very likely, push the price down.</Text>
