            <Text style={styles.p}>The advance block is the name given to a candlestick trading pattern. The pattern is a three-candle bearish setup that is considered to be a reversal patternâ€”a suggestion that price action is about to change from what had been an upward trend to a downward trend in relatively short time frames. Some authors suggest that in practice the formation often leads to a bullish continuation instead of a reversal.</Text>
