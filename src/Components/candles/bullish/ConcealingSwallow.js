            <Text style={styles.p}>The concealing baby swallow candlestick pattern is a bullish reversal pattern that appears during a downtrend. It consists of four candlesticks that give an early signal of a downtrendâ€™s deterioration. The logic behind this pattern is that bulls respond very quickly to the first two candles occurring during a downtrend. After the first two candles, the buying pressure increases, and prices reject to decline. It results in the formation of a long bullish candle that indicates an upcoming reversal of the trend. The concealing baby swallow is a very rare but reliable trading pattern. Although it is a bit tricky to identify the concealing baby swallow, it is a very important pattern that not only tells traders about trend reversal but also sheds light on the overall behavior of the market.</Text>

            <ul>
                <li>The first candle must be a Black Marubozu appearing during a downtrend. </li>
                <li>The second candle must also be a Black Marubozu. It opens within the body of the previous candle and closes below the previous closing price.</li>
                <li>The first two candles are without any upper or lower shadow.</li>
                <li>The third candle must be a High Wave without a lower shadow. It opens below the previous closing price while its upper shadow enters the body of the previous candle.</li>
                <li>The fourth candle must have a black body engulfing the body and upper shadow of the previous candle. </li>
            </ul>
