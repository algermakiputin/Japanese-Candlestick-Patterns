            <Text style={styles.p}>The three stars in the south is a bullish reversal pattern made up of three candles, and it comes up on candlestick charts. It may appear after a price fall, and it indicates that the bearishness is reducing. The pattern is very rare, it doesn’t appear easily.</Text>
            <Text style={styles.p}>It is discovered when during a downtrend, a long bearish candlestick with a long lower shadow is preceded by a smaller version of the initial candlestick with a lower high and a higher low, followed by a small black Marubozu which starts and ends in the range of the initial candlestick. It is necessary to remember that every price range is completely covered by the range of the previous candle.</Text>
