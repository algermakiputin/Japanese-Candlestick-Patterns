            <Text style={styles.p}>Three outside up is a three candle reversal pattern that can be bullish or bearish depending on the formation of the chart. The bullish implication on this pattern is if the second and third candle creates two successive higher closing price. The first candle on this pattern is a bearish confirming the negative market sentiment. The second candle gaps down during the trading session, but the buyers manage to close the price higher than the previous candle. If the third candle creates a new high, this signals a buying point for traders and could signal a potential bullish reversal.</Text>
