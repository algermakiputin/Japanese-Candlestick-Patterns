            <Text style={styles.p}>The Bullish Harami candlestick pattern is a reversal pattern appearing at the bottom of a downtrend. The first day of this pattern is a bearish candle with a large body, the next day is a bullish candle with a small body enclosed within the body of the prior candle. As a sign of changing momentum, the small bullish candle ‘gaps’ up to open near the mid-range of the previous candle. Some investors may look at a bullish harami as a good sign that they should enter a long position on an stock.</Text>
