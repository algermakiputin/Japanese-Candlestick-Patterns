            <Text style={styles.p}>As its name implies, this three-price candlestick pattern is very unique in that it extremely appears on the chart. If it appears on a bearish trend and the price moves higher after the pattern then itâ€™s a sign of a bullish reversal. The first candle of this pattern is a long bearish candle, the second candle is a hammer with a long lower shadow and the third candle is a short green candle, its opening price must be lower than the second candle and the open and close price must stay within the range of the second candle.</Text>
