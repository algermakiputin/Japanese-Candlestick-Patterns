            <Text style={styles.p}>A bullish Abandoned baby is a very reliable three-price bar candlestick reversal pattern that appears after a sharp decline in price indicating bearish market sentiment. The first bar of this pattern is a long bearish candle indicating the current trend, the second bar gaps down in the direction of the primary trend, and then the next bar gaps up and pushes the price higher. After a share price advance, this pattern is usually followed by a strong upside move. As you can see</Text>
            <Text style={styles.p}>As you can see this pattern is similar to morning star and evening star, the only main difference is that the body and its shadow cannot overlap with the other candle. </Text>
