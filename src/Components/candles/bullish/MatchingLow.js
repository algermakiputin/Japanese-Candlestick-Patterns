            <Text style={styles.p}>Matching low is a two candle pattern that shows a potential bullish reversal, both candles have no lower shadow and must have equal closing price. Itâ€™s not every day you can see two candlesticks with matching low and no lower shadows. Therefore, this candlestick pattern belongs to the pattern that you rarely see on the chart. The second candle of this pattern signifies that sellers failed to close the price below the first candle, this signals that the bearish sentiment is weakening and there could be a potential price rebound. Traders could see potential in this pattern and use the previous low as support or cut loss point. As a general rule, it is ideal to wait for confirmation before acting with every pattern.</Text>

            <Text style={styles.subHeading}>How to trade?</Text> 
            <Text style={styles.p}>The best way to trade this pattern is to look for a breakout above the high of the second candle. This will signal that the buyers are in control and that the downtrend is starting to reverse. Once the breakout occurs, you can then enter a long position and target the previous highs.</Text>
