            <Text style={styles.p}>Doji Star is a two-day candlestick pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a trend reversal. On the first day is a normal bearish candlestick. On the next day, the opening price should gap down, and the closing price is near to its opening price forming a Doji candle, this indicates that the market is not sure whether to continue going lower or to go higher. To trade this pattern it should be confirmed by a bullish candle on the next trading period.</Text>
